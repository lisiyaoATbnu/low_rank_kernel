The implementation of WACV 2019 paper "Understanding kernel size in blind deconvolution" by Siyao et al.

The non-blind deconvolution method used in this paper is proposed in "Fast Image Deconvolution using Hyper-Laplacian Priors" by Krishnan et al. The files"center_kernel_seperate.m", "fast_deconv_bregman.m", "solve_image_bregman" and the settings of non-blind deconvolution are forked from the author's website.
